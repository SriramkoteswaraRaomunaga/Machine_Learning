# 🌍 AI-Powered Mood-Based Trip Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Powered Mood-Based Trip Recommendation System helps users discover travel destinations based on their emotional state.

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze user text, identify emotions, map emotions to travel moods, and recommend suitable travel destinations.

Instead of directly predicting a location, the system detects the user's emotional condition and provides personalized travel recommendations.
